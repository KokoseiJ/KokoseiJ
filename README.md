## Introduction
Hello, I'm Kokosei J.

unlike the username I'm actually middle school student.

I've been messing around with Python for 3 years, and I'm sure I still have a lot more to learn.

I've been also touching Java for a while, and I'm also interested at learning Rust. Seems like a cool language.

I know that I'm not really good at writing codes and my codes have tons of problems, so If you happen to find something that you can fix, Please don't hesitate to send a PR. I'd really appreciate it.

Thank you, have a great day.

## Developement Environment
1. Distro: [Fedora 34 Cinnamon Spin](https://spins.fedoraproject.org/en/cinnamon/)
2. IDE: [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [IntelliJ IDEA Community](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)

2-monitor setup is really comfortable, if you ask me.

## Works
1. [DiscordBot](https://github.com/KokoseiJ/DiscordBot) - A.K.A Kyoko Kirigiri Bot, Designed to support dynamically adding commands using separate script files. Module codes are dirty and Not documented. You would be able to try to do something with it, though.
2. [NicoPlayer](https://github.com/KokoseiJ/NicoPlayer) - A simple player that lets you play songs from NicoVideo in a commandline. Very simple and basic, but I'm planning to completely renovate it.
3. [RHYTHMATICA](https://github.com/KokoseiJ/RHYTHMATICA) - A simple Rhythm game I've been working on. I stopped developing it due to lack of time, and the code quality is utter gibberish.

*There's always more to come!*
