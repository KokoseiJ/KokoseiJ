## Introduction
Hello, I'm Kokosei J.

~~unlike the username I'm actually middle school student.~~ Wow, could you believe that I'm actually a highschool student now?

I've been messing around with Python for 3 years, and I'm sure I still have a lot more to learn.

I've been also touching Java for a while, and I'm also interested at learning C. as I go deeper, I'm starting to see the advantage of pointers. Rust can wait for a while.

I know that I'm not really good at writing codes and my codes have tons of problems, so If you happen to find something that you can fix, Please don't hesitate to send a PR. I'd really appreciate it.

Thank you, have a great day.

## Developement Environment
1. Distro: [Fedora 34 Cinnamon Spin](https://spins.fedoraproject.org/en/cinnamon/)
2. IDE: [Sublime Text 4](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [IntelliJ IDEA Community](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)

## Works
1. [NicoBot](https://github.com/KokoseiJ/NicoBot) - Discord API Library for Python, threading-based. designed to be easy-to-use, flexible API wrapper.
2. [NicoPlayer](https://github.com/KokoseiJ/NicoPlayer) - A simple player that lets you play songs from NicoVideo in a commandline. Very simple and basic, but I'm planning to completely renovate it.
3. [DiscordBot](https://github.com/KokoseiJ/DiscordBot) - A.K.A Kyoko Kirigiri Bot, Designed to support dynamically adding commands using separate script files. Will be migrated from Discord.py to [DiscordAPI](https://github.com/KokoseiJ/NicoBot) as soon as the development finishes.

*There's always more to come!*
