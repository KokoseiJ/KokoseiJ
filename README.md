## Introduction
Hello, I'm Kokosei J.

I've been messing around with Python for 5 years and counting, and dabbled around Java/C#/JS. I went a bit further in with C, and C++ I didn't even bother touching. :P

I fully understand that my codes can and will always have issues here and there... so If you happen to find something that you can fix, Please don't hesitate to send a PR. I really really appreciate it.

Thank you, have a nice day!
